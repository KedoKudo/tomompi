This package is compiled by updating the Makefile in the following way:

(1) comment out the line "ALL : default" which generates an error "No rule to make target"

(2) Move the following two lines up to the top 

      all: fft recon support main link install reconsolo
      reconsolo : fft recon support tomosolo link_tomosolo

(3) Then run the recontruction by (in directory /clhome/TOMO/PANY/projects/TomoMPI/trunk/bin): 
   
      /clhome/aps_tools/mpich-1.2.6/bin/mpirun -machinefile pjnode.list -n 8 /clhome/TOMO/PANY/projects/TomoMPI/trunk/bin/tomompi ~/PANY/data/Sam14_Patrick Sam14_exp.hdf
   
   Or better, 

      /clhome/aps_tools/mpich-1.2.6/bin/mpirun -machinefile pjnode.list -n 8 /clhome/TOMO/PANY/projects/TomoMPI/trunk/bin/tomompi /tomography/PANY/Sam14_Patrick Sam14_exp.hdf

   The best way is to run the script in ./bin/runtomompi

    Lessons: (1) Use absolute path
             (2) Use the same version of mpirun to run the program as the version which compiles the program
